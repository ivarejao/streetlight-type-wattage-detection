# Streetlight Type and Wattage Classifier

This repository implements an end-to-end classifier for intelligent detection of street lighting lamp types and wattages using a visual pre-trained transformer. The model is trained on a dataset containing image descriptors obtained from experiments using traditional machine learning models.

## Features

- **End-to-End Classification:** The repository provides a complete solution for classifying street lighting lamp types and estimating wattages.

- **Visual Pre-trained Transformer:** The model leverages a visual pre-trained transformer for enhanced feature extraction and classification accuracy.

- **Dataset Information:** Details about the dataset used for training the model, including image descriptors obtained from experiments using traditional machine learning models.

## How to run the report experiments

Follow these steps:

1. **Get Images from the Data Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NINFA-UFES/PublicLightDataset
   ```
   rename the folder Images to img. Certify the folder is in the same diretory than the code.ipynb

2. **Run Notebook:**

   Run the notebook cells. Certify to install all requirements.


## Results

The model achieved promising results in terms of accuracy.
